# Maximum-mark-calculator
This mini project helps you to get high marks in limited time
It will be helpful for the students who study a day before the exam 
We used the concept of 0/1 Knapsack to achieve it
First the student should select the subject from the list of choices and then enter the time remaining in hours format
If do so we will get the recommendation of the topics to be studied to get the maximum mark in the stipulated time.
